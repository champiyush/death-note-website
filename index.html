                    <p style="font-size: 1.15em;">
                              In Tokyo, a disaffected high-school student named Light Yagami finds the "Death Note", a mysterious black notebook which can kill anyone as long as the user knows  both the target's name and face. Initially terrified of its god-like power, Light considers the possibilities of the Death Note's abilities and kills high-profile Japanese criminals, then targeting international criminals. Five days after discovering the notebook, Light is visited by Ryuk, a "Shinigami" and the Death Note's previous owner. Ryuk, invisible to anyone who has not touched the notebook, reveals that he dropped the notebook into the human world out of boredom and is amused by Light's actions.[5]

As criminals around the world die from inexplicable accidents and heart attacks, the global media suggest that a single mastermind is responsible for the mysterious murders and name him "Kira" (キラ, the Japanese transliteration of the English word "killer"). Hoping to apprehend Kira, Interpol requests the assistance of an enigmatic consulting detective, known as L, to assist their investigation. Deducing that Kira is based in Japan, L tricks Light into revealing that he is in the Kanto region of Japan by manipulating him to kill a decoy. Furious, Light vows to kill L, whom he views as obstructing his plans. L deduces that Kira has inside knowledge of the Japanese police investigation, being led by Light's father, Soichiro Yagami. Under the suspicion that "Kira" could have family ties with members of the "Kira" investigation, L assigns a team of FBI agents to monitor the families of those connected with the investigation and L learns enough to designate Light as the prime suspect. Around this time, Light graduates from high school to college. L recruits Light into the Kira Task Force, with each trying to get the other to reveal crucial information.

Actress-model Misa Amane, having obtained a second Death Note from a Shinigami named Rem, makes a deal with Rem for Shinigami eyes, which allow her to kill knowing only the face, at the cost of half her lifespan. Seeking to have Light become her boyfriend, Misa uncovers Light's identity as the original Kira, but Light has another motive: he intends to use Misa's Shinigami eyes to discern L's true name. L deduces that Misa is likely the second Kira and detains her. Rem threatens to kill Light if he does not find a way to save Misa. Light arranges a scheme in which he and Misa temporarily lose their memories of the Death Note, and has Rem pass the Death Note to a less morally driven individual, Kyosuke Higuchi of the Yotsuba Group. With memories of the Death Note erased, Light joins the investigation and, together with L, deduce Higuchi's identity and arrest him. Light regains his memories and uses the Death Note to kill Higuchi, regaining possession of the book. After restoring Misa's memories, Light instructs her to begin killing as Kira, causing L to cast suspicion on Misa. With Light insinuating the investigation would lead to Misa's capture and execution, Rem realizes Light's plan all along was to have her sacrifice herself to kill L, as a Shinigami may not kill others to prevent a human's death. After Rem kills L, she disintegrates and Light obtains her Death Note. The task force does not announce L's death and agrees to have Light operate as the new L. With Light working as both L and Kira, the investigation stalls but crime rates continue to drop as he no longer has threat of capture.

Four years later, cults have arisen which adore Kira. Two young men, raised as potential successors to L, are revealed: Near and Mello. Aware that L is dead, they consider Light, the current L, as a prime suspect. Mello, with Mafia assistance, kidnaps Light's sister, resulting in his father's death during a rescue mission. As suspicion falls again on Misa, Light passes Misa's Death Note to a fervent supporter of Kira, Teru Mikami. He also appoints newscaster Kiyomi Takada as Kira's public spokesperson. Realizing that Takada is connected to Kira, Mello kidnaps her. Takada kills Mello but is killed by Light. Near deduces Mikami's connection to Kira and arranges a meeting between Light and the current Kira Task Force members. Light tries to have Mikami kill Near as well as all the task force members, but Mikami's Death Note fails to work, having been replaced with a decoy. Perusing the names Mikami had written down, only Light's is missing, which proves Light is Kira. Light is grievously wounded in a scuffle and begs Ryuk to write the names of everyone present. Ryuk instead writes down Light's name in his Death Note, as Light declares himself as god of the new world before dying.

Three years later, Near, now functioning as the new L, receives word that a new Kira has appeared. Hearing that the new Kira is randomly killing people, Near concludes that the new Kira is an attention-seeker and denounces the new Kira as "boring" and not worth catching. A Shinigami named Midora approaches Ryuk and gives him an apple from the human realm, in a bet to see if a random human could become the new Kira, but Midora loses the bet when the human writes his own name in the Death Note after hearing Near's announcement. Ryuk tells Midora that no human would ever surpass Light as the new Kira.

                              <p>The protagonist of the series also ends up being its most compelling Death Note character by a mile, with the transformation of the honor student Light Yagami into the serial killer with a god-complex who goes by the moniker of Kira being a highly interesting one indeed.

                                        However, it's the manner in which Light manipulates everyone and everything around him that makes him all the more interesting to watch. While his web of lies is ultimately unraveled by the end, the journey is still highly compelling in every sense of the word.
                                        Light is characterized as hardworking, talented, and a natural genius. Highly perceptive and good with problem solving, Light was a skilled planner and good at mapping out scenarios. Furthermore, Light was very popular among peers and adored by his family members. However, his high intelligence and constant praise from adults laid the foundation for an intense level of hubris which quickly took effect once he obtained the notebook.

                                                  The world's greatest detective is also one of the best characters in anime history, and one need only look at L's quirky mannerisms and eccentric personality to understand why this is the case. His whole being, including his background as an orphan and his anti-social personality, is created as a foil to that of the handsome and popular Light.
                                                  However, L is more than just his analytic side. He ends up forming a genuine bond with Light and even considers him to be his one true friend, which is what makes his final moments all the more tragic.
                                                  L is very intelligent, though his disheveled and languid appearance masks his great powers of deduction and many question his abilities upon viewing him. L tends to second-guess everything he is presented with, and is extremely meticulous and analytical. He is good at deceiving his opponents, and is willing to take drastic measures to solve a case. Some of his tactics are quite bold, such as having death row inmate Lind L. Tailor pose as himself on live TV in order to draw out Kira, while others seem bizarre to those involved, such as handcuffing himself to suspected-Kira, Light Yagami. He is also shown to have a dry sense of humor, and he isn't above making sarcastic remarks to people. Although he tends to be polite, to some (such as Task Force member Shuichi Aizawa), L can seem condescending at times.

                                        <p>Of course, it would be impossible to talk about the best characters of Death Note without mentioning the brilliance of Ryuk — a Shinigami that ended up being one of the most compelling characters of the show.

                                                  While his whole trademark of finding humans intriguing stays stagnant throughout the entire series, it's still interesting enough to make him one of the best Death Note characters even though his arc might not be all that significant. He is a bored Shinigami that drops a Death Note, a notebook that allows the user to kill anyone simply by knowing their name and face, into the human world in order to have relief from his boredom.
                                                  Ryuk is different from most Shinigami in that he does not want to simply pass time away in the Shinigami Realm but find something to relieve his boredom, and he is unaffected by the mocking he receives from other Shinigami for it.

                                        <p>Misa is very outgoing and is shown to be quite popular due to her career. She attracts a large crowd while visiting Light near his school.[5] She is hyperactive, impulsive, and otherwise childlike, evidenced by her tendency to speak in the third person. Despite being considered idiotic by many, Misa is shown to have moments of intelligence, such as when she successfully tricks Kyosuke Higuchi into revealing himself to be the Yotsuba Kira.[6] However, even though she is more powerful than Light as Kira, she is very careless in her acts as the Second Kira, which leads to her being arrested and put in confinement on suspicion that she is is the second Kira. As she likely didn't know the Death Note could manipulate victims, and thus mailed the tapes herself; failed to ensure there was no DNA on the envelopes she sent the tapes in; completely ignored Light's order to stay away (as he was already suspected of being Kira) as he predicted L was having him followed.

                                                  Although she is generally nice to those she meets, she can also be quite cruel: she tells Light that she would kill any other girls he dates,[7] despite said girls being part of his plan to appear as a normal young man to the investigators and deflect suspicion from himself and Misa.

                              Ohba keeps his real identity a secret and writes under a pen name. The truth of his real name, birthday, or any personal information has been undisclosed since he began his career back in 2003 with Death Note. Other characteristics shared with L include his habit of bringing his knees to his chest in a chair while thinking of manga plots. There is some speculation that he may be writer Hiroshi Gamo, but there is no conclusive proof.

                    <h1>Fact-2: Has Been Banned In China And Almost Banned In The US And Russia

                    <p style="background-color: grey; color: black; word-spacing: 1rem;">
                              Though the Death Note manga and anime have garnered great reviews and popularity throughout the world, some countries were so shocked by the material that they attempted to ban the work completed. According to Xinhuanet.com, school officials initiated bans due to an increasing number of students creating their own custom Death Notes and bringing them to school.

                              The manga was banned in 2005 in Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning Province (People's Republic of China). Later, the ban grew to include “Beijing, Shanghai, and Lanzhou in Gansu Province.” The ban was approved as a basis for preserving “’physical and mental health’ of students from horror material that ‘misleads innocent children and distorts their mind and spirit’.”  Additional attempted bans took place in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 2010 and in Russia in 2013. However, neither of the bans were approved for each area, and copies of the manga remained available for purchase.

                    <h1>Fact-3: Different Death Notes

                    <p style="background-color: grey; color: black; word-spacing: 1rem;">
                              The Death Note, though deadly in its abilities, took the form of an ordinary notebook. Despite the ominous named inscribed on the cover, no one would be suspicious of such an ordinary possession. In fact, that made it the perfect disguise for a normal teenager looking to become a god of his world. However, initial designs for the Death Note itself were intended to be a lot more creative and adaptive.

According to Death Note: The Unofficial Guide, Artist Takeshi Obata originally thought of the books as "Bible-like... Something you would automatically think was a Death Note." So, depending on where the Death Note ended up, it would reflect the culture and traditions of that time period. Some examples included “resembling scrolls in ancient Japan, or the Old Testament in Medieval Europe.” Given the complexity and constant changes required to complete this design, the idea was scrapped for the now famous college notebook design.

                    <h1>Fact-4: L’s Last Name
                    </h1>
                    <p style="background-color: grey; color: black; word-spacing: 1rem;">
                              Light is unsuccessful in uncovering L’s name and must use Rem, Misa’s Shinigami, to write L’s name in the Death Note. Because Rem is a Shinigami, she is able to see L’s full name and lifespan. To save Misa, Rem sacrifices herself by writing L’s name in the Death Note. Misa also had Shinigami eyes during the series and once knew L’s name.

                              When Misa is forced to give up her Death Note, her eyes disappear with it. In Death Note 13: How to Read, character profiles created by Ohba and Obata can be found. There it states L’s real name is L Lawliet, and Lawliet is pronounced as “low light”.

                    <h1>Fact-5: L Beat Light
                    </h1>
                    <p style="background-color: grey; color: black; word-spacing: 1rem;">
                              One of the most important moments in the series is when Light killed L. He put Misa in danger so Rem would save her by writing L's name in her notebook. In nearly every adaptation, Light defeats L. However, there is a story called L: Change the WorLd, L wrote his name into the Death Note so he would have enough time to catch Light before dying. Not even Kira could see that kill coming.
